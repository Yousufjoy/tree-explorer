I used **Next.js with TypeScript** and **Next.js API routes** because this is the stack I normally work with and it lets me handle both frontend and backend in the same project.

To run the project after cloning:

For **bun**:

```
bun install
bun run dev
```

Or with **npm**:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Bonus features included:**

* Add and Rename option in each node and in the root
* Undo for the last action (add/delete/rename)
* Displaying formatted JSON

**Live demo:** : https://tree-explorer-theta.vercel.app/
